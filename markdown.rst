Code and Syntax Highlighting
----------------------------

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
```

Please, create next doc:

See ``test.py`` code below:

.. code:: python

    text = "Hello, World!"
    print(text)
